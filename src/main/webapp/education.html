            <p>Black Lives Matter is an organized movement that advocates for civil protest
            against acts of systemic anti-Black racism and state-sanctioned violence that disproportionately 
            affects Black lives. The founders Alice Garza, Patrisse Khan-Cullors, and Opal Tometi started the 
            movement to connect all those with a shared interest to fight injustices against the Black community 
            and to create a space inclusive to all Black Lives.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>#BlackLivesMatter emerged in 2013 as a call to action on social media in response to the 
                acquittal of Trayvon Martin’s murderer. Upon the deaths of Mike Brown and Eric Garner at 
                the hands of law enforcement in 2014, the movement progressed from social media 
                to physical demonstrations thus becoming a nationally recognized movement. Since then, many
                have taken to the streets to protest against the wrongful deaths of more Black lives by police conduct,
                as well as the lack of accountability held against these officers. Though Black people only make up 13% 
                of the overall US population, they are killed at more than twice the rate than that of a White person.
                Black people are clearly killed at an inordinate rate.

            <p>There are many more disheartening statistics reflecting blatant, anti-Black, and systemic racism.
               These examples are reflected in the demographics of US prisons, housing, and most recently the Covid-19 pandemic. 
               The video below goes into greater detail concerning systemic racism against Black people in the US.

                The BLM fight to bring attention and change to these disparities has incited its expansion.
                Along with the strong social media presence, Black Lives Matter activists have taken to 
                the streets in massive protests that have taken place worldwide. In the wake of George Floyd’s 
                death, there have been protests in all 50 states in addition to over 70 different countries all 
                over the world, which are shown belown highlighted in green.

                With the latest upsurge in protests, Black Lives Matter is considered to be the largest movement in US history.
                This widespread movement has caused many from individuals to billion-dollar corporations to reflect on 
                their actions and how they can make a difference. To find out how you can get invloved locally, visit the
